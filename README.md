## Overview

This is a Node.js library for integrating with the [Braintree](http://www.braintreepayments.com) gateway.

The library is a work in progress and a few features are still missing. Until
we hit version 1.0 we may break backwards compatibility, but the changes
should be minimal. We're using [semantic versioning](http://semver.org/).
[Email us](mailto:support@braintreepayments.com) if you have any questions.

    var gateway = braintree.connect({
      environment: braintree.Environment.Sandbox,
      merchantId: 'your_merchant_id',
      publicKey: 'your_public_key',
      privateKey: 'your_private_key'
    });

    gateway.transaction.sale({
      amount: '5.00',
      creditCard: {
        number: '5105105105105100',
        expirationDate: '05/12'
      }
    }, function (err, result) {
      if (err) throw err;

      if (result.success) {
        util.log('Transaction ID: ' + result.transaction.id);
      } else {
        util.log(result.message);
      }
    });
